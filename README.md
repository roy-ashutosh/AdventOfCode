This project is a Swift template designed to help you quickly get started with solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (AoC) challenges. Each December, Advent of Code releases a new programming puzzle every day leading up to Christmas. This template provides a clean and simple setup so you can focus on solving the puzzles without spending time on initial project configuration.
